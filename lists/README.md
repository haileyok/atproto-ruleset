# Lists

> [!WARNING]
> Some files in this directory such as `slurs.yaml` contain content that you may find offensive.

Lists here are loaded into Osprey and are cached either as lists of strings or as lists of regex patterns (for example, when "censorizing" a list of phrases to be matched against
common Unicode characters). Lists should be simple YAML formatted lists, without complex YAML formatting.
